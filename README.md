# channel-sounder-5G



## Getting started

A measurement system based on channel sounding technique,
which will enable accurate and comprehensive measurements of propagation characteristics under conditions conditions associated with IIoT and 5G technologies. 


Channel sounding - a technique for evaluating radio environment
for wireless communications, especially multi-antenna systems
used in 5G.  Due to the impact of terrain changes and the presence of obstacles, wireless signals propagate along along multiple paths.
