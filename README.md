# channel-sounder-5G



## Description

A measurement system based on channel sounding technique,
which will enable accurate and comprehensive measurements of propagation characteristics under conditions associated with IIoT and 5G technologies. 


Channel sounding - a technique for evaluating radio environment for wireless communications, especially multi-antenna systems
used in 5G. Due to the impact of terrain changes and the presence of obstacles, wireless signals propagate along along multiple paths. 

## Code

Python scripts will handle communication between the microcomputer (RaspberryPi), spectrum analyzer and signal generator.
They will also provide control of measurement exectuion and data visualization.

## Communictaion 

System will be controlled from a remote computer connected to the SBC via SSH protocol over WiFI network. Measuring devices will be controlled over Ethernet network.
